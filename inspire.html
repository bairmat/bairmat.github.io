            What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A great capacity for creativity</li>
            <li>A willingness to share their ideas and talents with the world</li>
            <li>The dedication to put their dreams and goals into practice</li>
            <li>An intense passion for what they do</li>
            <li>The wisdom to pass on their knowledge to the following generation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I wholeheartedly believe that very few people can display these characteristics as well as Stan Lee. This man has left an enormous mark on the world with his amazing works of creativity, sparking wonder and joy in countless hearts across all corners.
